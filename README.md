# Phonebook-Management-System
This is a project which aims at creating a blueprint for the internal working of the phonebooks installed in our devices. I have used Ordered maps(BST implementation), unordered_maps and vectors for the creation of a phonebook and implemented various operations in the least time complexity possible. It also comes with a virtual call function and also provides the user with a call log and favourites list.


More updates soon
